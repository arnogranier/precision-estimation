# Precision estimation and second-order prediction errors in cortical circuits

This repository includes code to reproduce the results of the paper "Precision estimation and second-order prediction errors in cortical circuits" ADD FULL CITE + link. 

This is written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and make use of packages `Random.jl`, `Distributions.jl`, `Plots.jl`, `LinearAlgebra.jl`, `LaTeXStrings.jl`. 

Figure panels can be rerproduced by running the corresponding code, e.g.
```console
julia -i 3b.jl
```
